**Project Management System**

Using ASP.NET and Microsoft SQL, Team 18 has developed a project management system that allows its users to manage projects across departments, track of team members' hours on projects, manage tasks within projects, monitor project status, and generate reports on departmental efforts, costs, and employee productivity. By assigning our users to one of three roles - admin, manager, or employee - we can ensure the success of managing the company.
